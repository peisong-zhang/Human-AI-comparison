You will see:\n\n- Heart Rate (HR)\n- Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)\n- Respiratory Rate (RR)\n- PaCO₂\n- Tidal Volume (Vt)\n- PaO₂/FiO₂\n\nGreen bars indicate mechanical ventilation (Vent). Blue, red, and purple bars represent No Vent (None), Vasopressor use (Vaso), and Both Vent + Vaso respectively. Patient age, sex, and primary diagnosis (e.g. CHF, MI) are listed above the plot.\n\n### Clinical Task\nDetermine whether the patient will require re-intubation (restart of mechanical ventilation) within the next 6 hours. Base your decision on:\n\n- Respiratory patterns (RR, PaO₂/FiO₂, PaCO₂, tidal volume)\n- Cardiovascular stability (HR, MAP)\n- Treatment interventions and their duration\n- Patient background information\n\nThis condition is **without AI assistance**—rely solely on the figure and your clinical judgement.",
